# shark

## [Video demo](https://youtu.be/X-79IL7RC6Y)

This is a simple game called 'shark'.<br>
The objective is to reach the flag in each randomly generated level<br>.
<br>
You can use WASD to move 1 tile at a time. If you hold shift, you will "dash", moving 2 tiles at a time, phasing through the first tile.<br>
Touching a colored tile will kill you, and touching an arrow will push you one tile in the direction that it is pointing.<br>
<br>
You are also on a timer!<br>
Every 10 levels, the timer will get faster and faster, until level 80 where it caps at 2.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
Since levels are randomly generated, sometimes they can be impossible!<br>
If you think that the level you are on is impossible, press X!<br>
If the level is impossible, you will pass after pressing X. But if it is possible, you will fail instantly.<br>
<br>
You can also customize your character, keybinds, and disable dashes, impossible levels, or the timer!<br>
<br>
This is an endless game. How fast can you swim?
